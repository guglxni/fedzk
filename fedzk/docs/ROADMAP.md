# FedZK Implementation Plan

This document outlines the next steps for FedZK, grouped by theme:

## 1. Circuits & ZK-Logic

- Parameterize & generalize
  - Make `n`, the L₂-threshold, and the nonzero-count bound configurable at run time.
  - Support other norms (L₁, L∞) and statistical measures (mean, variance, median).
- New cheat-proof primitives
  - Range proofs to show each gradient lies within a bound [–B, B] without revealing its value.
  - Zero-knowledge dot-product or sum-to-zero checks for additional integrity guarantees.
- Circuit optimization
  - Fuse accumulation steps and reduce gate counts for faster proofs.
  - Experiment with PLONK backend or alternative SNARK setups to shrink proof size and improve performance.

## 2. Client/Coordinator Workflow

- Multi-round support
  - Automate iterative federated training rounds with stateful coordination.
  - Build a driver script or scheduler that orchestrates multiple clients in parallel.
- Anonymity & fairness
  - Implement anonymous aggregation (proving membership without revealing identity).
  - Add Sybil-resistance proofs to ensure contributions come from distinct data samples.

## 3. Python Library & CLI UX

- Higher-level API
  - Provide `FedZKProver` and `FedZKVerifier` Python classes for clean integration into ML pipelines.
- CLI improvements
  - Offer single commands like `fedzk train` and `fedzk prove` to compile circuits, generate proofs, and send them.
  - Add `--dry-run` and `--profile` modes for diagnostics and performance profiling.

## 4. Testing, CI & Quality

- Circom in CI
  - Add a GitHub Actions step to run `circom --check` on every pull request, catching parse or formatting issues early.
- Fuzz & edge-case tests
  - Randomize gradient inputs (including zeros, negatives, max values) to stress-test both circuits and Python logic.
- Benchmark automation
  - Compare proof sizes and generation/verification timings across different Circom versions and SNARK backends.

## 5. Documentation & Onboarding

- Tutorials & cookbooks
  - Step-by-step guide: how to add your own ZK check (for example, an L∞ norm circuit).
  - Jupyter notebook or video demo showing an end-to-end privacy-preserving federated training workflow.
- Architecture diagram
  - Visualize the data and proof flow: client → circuit → proof → coordinator → aggregation.

## 6. Real-world Integration

- Deep integration with ML frameworks
  - Provide TensorFlow and PyTorch hooks to feed real training gradients directly into the proof pipeline.
- Scalable deployment
  - Package client and coordinator as Docker microservices with HTTP/gRPC interfaces.
- Use-case prototypes
  - Build demos in domains like healthcare or finance to showcase privacy and integrity guarantees.

## 7. Research & Extensions

- Alternative ZK frameworks
  - Evaluate the next-generation tools (Circom 3, Halo2, Cairo, STARK-based systems) for different trust and performance models.
- Formal verification
  - Use formal methods (ZoKrates, TLA+) to rigorously verify the correctness of aggregation logic.
