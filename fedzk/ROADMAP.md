# FedZK Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for FedZK. It serves as a guide for contributors and users to understand the project's direction.

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

- ✅ Core federated learning workflow with zero-knowledge proofs
- ✅ Basic MPC server for remote proof generation and verification
- ✅ Coordinator API for model aggregation
- ✅ Command-line interface for all operations
- ✅ Simple benchmarking suite
- ✅ API key authentication

## Short-Term Goals (v0.2.0)

- [ ] Improved error handling and recovery for network issues
- [ ] Expanded circuit templates for more complex models
- [ ] Support for custom aggregation strategies
- [ ] WebUI for monitoring coordinator and MPC server
- [ ] Enhanced logging and telemetry
- [ ] Docker images for easy deployment

## Mid-Term Goals (v0.3.0)

- [ ] Horizontal scaling support for the MPC server
- [ ] Integration with popular machine learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- [ ] Advanced privacy features (differential privacy, secure aggregation)
- [ ] Federated learning with heterogeneous models
- [ ] Support for asynchronous federated learning
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation website

## Long-Term Vision

- [ ] Production-ready deployment with high availability
- [ ] Multi-cloud federated learning support
- [ ] Advanced zero-knowledge circuit optimization
- [ ] SDK for mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Integration with federated analytics
- [ ] Support for encrypted model storage and transport
- [ ] Advanced attack prevention mechanisms

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to any aspect of the roadmap. If you're interested in helping with a specific feature:
