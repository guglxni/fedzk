# Implementation Details

This document provides technical details about FedZK's implementation, including technologies, algorithms, and design decisions.

## Core Technologies

FedZK leverages the following technologies:

- **Python**: Primary implementation language
- **PyTorch**: For model training and gradient computation
- **Circom**: For zero-knowledge circuit definition
- **SnarkJS**: For zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- **FastAPI**: For coordinator API endpoints (optional)
- **Typer**: For command-line interface

## Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

### Circuit Design

FedZK uses arithmetic circuits defined in Circom to specify constraints for model updates. The main circuits include:

1. **Model Update Circuit**: Verifies basic properties of model updates
   ```circom
   template ModelUpdate(n) {
       signal input weights[n];
       signal input updates[n];
       signal input norm_bound;
       signal output valid;
       
       // Implementation of constraints
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Secure Update Circuit**: Adds additional privacy constraints
   ```circom
   template SecureUpdate(n) {
       signal input weights[n];
       signal input updates[n];
       signal input noise_params[2];
       signal input norm_bound;
       signal output valid;
       
       // Implementation with privacy guarantees
       // ...
   }
   ```

### Proof Generation Process

The proof generation follows these steps:

1. Convert model updates to circuit-compatible format
2. Generate witnesses for the circuit
3. Create a proof using the Groth16 proving system
4. Return the proof along with public inputs

### Verification Process

Verification is performed by:

1. Receiving a proof and public inputs
2. Validating the proof structure
3. Running the verification algorithm
4. Returning a boolean indicating validity

## Federated Learning Implementation

### Client-Side Training

The training process on client nodes:

1. Loads the local dataset
2. Initializes or updates the model
3. Trains for a specified number of epochs
4. Computes the update as the difference from the initial model
5. Generates a proof for the update

Sample implementation of the training loop:

```python
def train(self, data, epochs=10):
    initial_weights = self.model.get_weights()
    
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        for batch in data.batches():
            # Forward pass
            outputs = self.model(batch.inputs)
            
            # Compute loss
            loss = self.loss_fn(outputs, batch.targets)
            
            # Backward pass
            self.optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            self.optimizer.step()
    
    final_weights = self.model.get_weights()
    updates = compute_difference(final_weights, initial_weights)
    
    return updates
```

### Coordinator Implementation

The coordinator manages the federated learning process through:

1. A client registry to track participating clients
2. A round manager to organize training rounds
3. A verification module to check proofs
4. An aggregation module to combine updates

## Security Measures

### Privacy Protections

FedZK implements several privacy protections:

1. **Local Training**: Data never leaves client devices
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Model updates are verified without revealing data
3. **Differential Privacy**: Optional noise addition to prevent inference attacks
4. **Secure Aggregation**: MPC techniques to protect individual updates

### Cryptographic Guarantees

The system provides the following cryptographic guarantees:

1. **Soundness**: Invalid updates cannot generate valid proofs
2. **Completeness**: Valid updates always produce valid proofs
3. **Zero-Knowledge**: Proofs reveal nothing about the private data

## Performance Optimizations

FedZK includes several optimizations:

1. **Batched Proof Generation**: Proofs are generated in batches for efficiency
2. **Circuit Optimization**: Circuits are designed for minimal constraint count
3. **Hardware Acceleration**: GPU support for faster proof generation
4. **Model Compression**: Reduced communication overhead

## Extensibility Mechanisms

### Custom Circuits

Developers can define custom circuits by:

1. Creating a circuit file in Circom
2. Compiling it to generate proving/verification keys
3. Registering the circuit with the system

### Custom Aggregation Strategies

The system supports different aggregation strategies:

1. **FedAvg**: Standard federated averaging
2. **FedProx**: Proximal term for better convergence
3. **SCAFFOLD**: Control variate for reduced client drift

## Testing Strategy

FedZK employs a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
3. **End-to-End Tests**: For full system validation
4. **Benchmark Tests**: For performance evaluation
