# FEDzk Production Status

## ✅ TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE

The FEDzk codebase has been successfully transformed from a research prototype into a production-grade federated learning framework with real zero-knowledge proofs.

## Key Features Implemented:
- 🔒 **Real ZK Proofs**: Groth16 circuits with Circom/SNARKjs backend (no simulation)
- 🚀 **Batch Processing**: Concurrent proof generation with GPU acceleration
- 🔐 **Differential Privacy**: ZKDP integration for privacy-preserving FL
- 🛡️ **Secure Aggregation**: ECC-based multi-party computation
- 🏗️ **Production Deployment**: Docker, K8s, monitoring ready
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization**: Benchmarking and automated tuning
- 📚 **Complete Documentation**: Automated setup via Jupyter notebook

## Quick Start:
```bash
# 1. Set up ZK toolchain
./scripts/setup_zk.sh

# 2. Run automated integration
jupyter notebook FEDzk_Production_ZK_Starter_Pack.ipynb

# 3. Test everything works
FEDZK_TEST_MODE=true python -m pytest src/fedzk/tests/
```

## Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION USE
